## Error Handling Middleware Module Documentation

This document describes the `catchAsync` middleware, a utility function for handling errors in asynchronous Express route handlers.

**Purpose:**

- Simplifies error handling in your Express application.
- Wraps asynchronous route handlers, catching any errors thrown within them.
- Ensures consistent error handling across your routes.

**Functionality:**

- Takes an asynchronous function (typically an Express route handler) as input.
- Returns a wrapped function that utilizes Express middleware functionality.
- When the wrapped function executes, it attempts to resolve the promise returned by the original function.
- If an error occurs during execution, the `catch` block intercepts it.
- The caught error is then passed to the `next` function in the middleware chain. This allows for centralized error handling further down the pipeline.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces boilerplate code by centralizing error handling logic.
- Improves code readability and maintainability by keeping route handlers clean.
- Promotes a consistent approach to error handling throughout your application.

**Usage:**

1. Import the `catchAsync` function from the middleware module:

```javascript
const { catchAsync } = require('../middlewares');
```

2. Wrap your asynchronous route handler with the `catchAsync` function:

```javascript
router.get('/users', catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Your route handler logic here
  const users = await User.find();
  res.json(users);
}));
```

**Example:**

The provided code snippet showcases how to utilize `catchAsync` in an Express route handler for fetching users. Any errors that might occur during the asynchronous operation (e.g., database query failure) will be caught and passed to the next middleware for centralized error handling.

By incorporating `catchAsync` in your Express application, you can streamline error handling and maintain clean and consistent route handler code.
