## NodeAuthRestAPI Application Lifecycle

The NodeAuthRestAPI follows a well-defined application lifecycle, encompassing various stages from initialization to graceful termination. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for effectively managing and developing the Node.js application.

### Initialization Phase

1. **Dependency Loading and Configuration**
    - The application begins by loading necessary dependencies such as `mongoose`, `config`, `express`, and custom utilities (`logger`).
    - Configuration settings are loaded from `config.js` and environmental variables (using `dotenv`) to establish environment-specific parameters like database URI and server port.

2. **Database Connection**
    - Upon initialization, NodeAuthRestAPI establishes a connection to the MongoDB database specified in `config.DB_URI` using `mongoose.connect()`.
    - This connection enables interaction with the database throughout the application's lifecycle.

### Server Initialization

1. **Express App Setup (`app.js`):**
    - The Express application is initialized and configured (`const app = express();`).
    - Middleware functions are applied to enhance security, logging, and request handling:
        - **Security Middleware:** `helmet()` sets HTTP headers to improve security.
        - **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Middleware:** `cors()` allows cross-origin requests.
        - **HTTP Request Logging Middleware:** `httpLogger` logs incoming HTTP requests.
        - **Body Parsing Middleware:** `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` parse JSON and URL-encoded request bodies.
        - **Compression Middleware:** `compression()` compresses response bodies to optimize data transfer.

2. **Static File Serving and Routing Setup**
    - Static files (e.g., images, CSS) are served using `express.static()` to serve assets stored in the `public` directory.for Express Applications
    - API routes (`/v1/`) are defined and configured to handle specific endpoint paths using the `router` from the `routes/v1/` directory.

### Request Handling

1. **Middleware Execution**
    - Incoming HTTP requests pass through middleware functions (`rateLimiter`, `httpLogger`, etc.) defined in the `middlewares/` directory.
    - Middleware functions preprocess requests before they reach route handlers.

2. **Route Handling**
    - The Express router (`router`) directs incoming requests to appropriate route handlers (`controllers/`) based on defined endpoint paths.

3. **Controller Execution**
    - Controller functions (`auth.controller.js`, `user.controller.js`) execute business logic associated with each endpoint.
    - Controllers interact with services (`services/`) to perform CRUD operations on database models (`models/`).

### Error Handling

1. **Error Middleware**
    - Errors are handled and converted into standardized error responses using `errorConverter` and `errorHandler` middleware.
    - Custom error classes (`ApiError.js`) define and format error responses for consistency.

2. **Sentry Integration**
    - Errors are tracked and logged using Sentry (`sentry.js`) to facilitate monitoring and debugging.
    - Sentry error handlers (`Handlers.errorHandler()`) capture and report errors for analysis.

### Graceful Termination

1. **Signal Handling (`index.js`):**
    - Signal handlers (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`) are registered to gracefully shut down the application in response to termination signals (e.g., Ctrl+C).

2. **Process Termination**
    - The `terminateProcess()` function is invoked upon termination signals or unhandled errors to close server connections and terminate the application gracefully.

### Conclusion

The NodeAuthRestAPI application lifecycle ensures smooth operation and management of the Node.js application from initialization to termination. By understanding and following this lifecycle, developers can effectively develop, deploy, and maintain robust RESTful APIs with user authentication and database integration. Proper error handling and graceful termination mechanisms contribute to the application's reliability and stability during runtime.
